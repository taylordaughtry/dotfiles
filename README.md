# dotfiles

The preferred configuration for the apps I use on a daily basis.

# Installation

open Terminal, and run these commands:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/taylordaughtry/dotfiles.git dotfiles
cd dotfiles
bash installer.sh
```

This will clone the repo to your user directory in the proper place, then run
the installer script to set everything up. **This will overwrite your current
`.bash_profile` and Sublime Settings..** Be sure you don't need anything from
them before you run the installer script.
